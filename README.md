# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze the outcomes of funding campaigns for theaters and plays to help Louise better understand the results of the funding campaign for her play "Fever". Her play came close to its funding goal and she would like to better understand how this compares against other campaigns in relation to both the start date and funding goal. By analyzing other campaigns, Louise is better able to determine if her campaign results are on par with similar ones.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Outcomes were analyzed based on the parent category of "Theater" and month of campaign launch. 
 - All subcategories under the "Theater" parent category were included in the analysis. 
 - All years of launch were included in the analysis. 
 - Outcomes of "succcessful", "failed" and "canceled" were considered; outcomes of "live" were excluded from the analysis.

The fundraising campaign for the play "Fever" was launched in the month of June. A total of 153 campaigns, including "Fever", were launched within the month of June with an outcome of either successful, failed or canceled. The breakdown of campaign success/failed/canceled rates is as follows:
 - Successful:  100 campaigns (65% of total)
 - Failed:  49 campaigns (32% of total)
 - Canceled:  4 campaigns (3% of total)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Outcomes were also analyzed based on the subcategory "plays" and total goal ($) amount.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

### Conclusions - Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on launch date, the campaign for "Fever" did not perform as well as other theater campaigns launched in the same month. 65% of campaigns were successful while "Fever" was not and failed to meet its goal.

The launch month of June has the second highest successful outcomes; the month of May has the highest. While May has a higher number of successful outcomes, it also has a higher number of campaigns launched. The overall percentage of successful Theater campaigns in May is 67% of the total, compared to 65% for the month of June. "Fever" would have had only a slightly better chance of being successful had it been launched in May.

When comparing all of the launch months' success and failure rates as a percentage of total, May and Jne have the highest percentage of successful campaigns. This indicates that while "Fever" did not perform as well as the majority of campaigns launched in June, launching in a different month would not have significantly increased the odds of being successful.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
