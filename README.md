# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze the outcomes of funding campaigns for theaters and plays to help Louise better understand the results of the funding campaign for her play "Fever". Her play came close to its funding goal and she would like to better understand how this compares against other campaigns in relation to both the start date and funding goal. By analyzing other campaigns, Louise is better able to determine if her campaign results are on par with similar ones.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Outcomes were analyzed based on the parent category of "Theater" and month of campaign launch. 
 - All subcategories under the "Theater" parent category were included in the analysis. 
 - All years of launch were included in the analysis.
